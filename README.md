# What is Ethical Hacking?
The phrases "ethical hacking" and "ethical hacker" refer to hacking carried out by an organization or a single person to assist in locating possible dangers on a computer or network. An ethical hacker looks for any vulnerabilities that malevolent hackers might exploit by getting around system security. The company then makes use of this data to strengthen system security in an effort to reduce or completely eradicate any potential threats (P, 2016). 
Ethical hackers abilities and mentality are on par with those of malevolent hackers but ethical hackers are trustworthy. furthermore, The ability to hack target systems is certified and granted to ethical hackers. (Ushmani, 2018)


# Different types of hackers

Ethical hackers are another name for white hat hackers. They never mean to cause harm to a system; instead, as part of vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, they look for flaws in a computer or network system. One of the hardest occupations in the IT sector is ethical hacking, and it's legal. Many businesses employ ethical hackers to perform vulnerability analyses and penetration tests.

2-	Black Hat Hackers:

3-	Grey Hat Hackers  
Black hat and white hat hackers are combined to create grey hat hackers. Without the owner's knowledge or consent, they take advantage of a security flaw in a computer system or network for their own amusement, acting with no harmful intent. Their goal is to alert the owners to the weakness so they can show their gratitude or offer a small reward. (Ltd, 2018)

# Abstract:

An ethical hacker is a cybersecurity professional who's hired to identify vulnerabilities and sins in an association's computer systems, networks, and operations. They use the same ways and tools as vicious hackers, but with the end of perfecting security rather than causing harm. The primary responsibility of an ethical hacker is to identify vulnerabilities and sins in an association's computer systems, networks, and operations. This involves conducting thorough and comprehensive security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning. Once vulnerabilities have been linked, it's the ethical hacker's responsibility to report their findings to the association's IT and security brigades. They should give detailed reports that outline the vulnerabilities, the implicit impact of exploitation, and recommendations for remediation. Ethical hackers are also responsible for testing the effectiveness of an association's security controls. This involves trying to bypass security
measures similar as firewalls, intrusion discovery systems, and access controls to determine if they can be circumvented by attackers. Finally, ethical hackers must stay over- to- date with arising pitfalls and new attack ways. They should continuously probe and test new tools and ways to insure they're suitable to identify and alleviate the rearmost pitfalls.
